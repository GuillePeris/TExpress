#' Get Normalized Counts from DESeq2 Object
#'
#' Extracts normalized count data from a DESeqDataSet object. Counts are
#' normalized by size factors to account for differences in sequencing depth
#' between samples.
#'
#' @param dds A DESeqDataSet object as returned by \code{\link{call_deseq2}}.
#'   Size factors must have been calculated (automatically done by
#'   \code{DESeq2::DESeq()}).
#'
#' @details
#' This is a convenience wrapper around \code{DESeq2::counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)}.
#' 
#' Normalized counts are calculated by dividing raw counts by size factors.
#' These counts are appropriate for visualization and clustering, but should
#' NOT be used as input for differential expression analysis (use raw counts
#' for that).
#'
#' @return A numeric matrix with normalized counts. Features in rows, samples
#'   in columns. Row and column names are preserved from the DESeqDataSet.
