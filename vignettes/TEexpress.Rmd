# Introduction
**TEexpress** is an R package for the downstream analysis of transposable element (TE) expression from quantification tools such as *TEtranscripts*. In addition to performing differential expression analysis using *DESeq2*, **TEexpress** annotates TEs with respect to genomic features and classifies their expression as originating either from the TE’s own promoter (*self-expressed*) or from an external promoter, typically *gene-dependent*.

# Standard workflow



```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
library(TEexpress)
```
